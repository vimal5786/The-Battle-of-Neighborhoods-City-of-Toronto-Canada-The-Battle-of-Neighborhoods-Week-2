    "Discussion:\n",
    "5.1 Explaining the results\n",
    "\n",
    "As we built our list of neighborhoods with Restaurant venues exclusively we discovered most neighborhoods were similar and the greatest concentration of restaurants was in Central Toronto and downtown Toronto. This might seem obvious but it would also appear that these are some of the most affluent neighborhoods in Toronto so there appears to be correlation. By Locating in the general vicinity of the Exact location my friend could be geographically centered in this cluster and poised to service his restaurant customer base with the greatest efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we built our our K-Means dataset we used Silhouette analysis to tell us there was a lot of similarity between neighborhoods and the most common restaurants contained with in. Really there was only 2 types of cluster or neighborhoods in greater Toronto. The vast majority of those were in 1 cluster. So Toronto restaurants might be many but they are very homogeneously located near the center of Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 103 Toronto Neighborhoods gathered only 55.3% or 57 Neighborhoods are above the median after-tax income. 37.8% or 39 Neighborhoods are below he median after-tax income. 6.7% or 7 neighborhoods did not register as it appears their populations are too low. It appears that the greatest concentration of affluence is near central Toronto. We decided to keep all neighborhoods in the dataset regardless of income of population as the majority were close enough.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel confident with the recommendation I have given my friend as it is backed up with demonstrated data analysis. While nothing can ever be 100% certain he will certainly be better informed than he was prior to asking for my help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much more inference can be obtained with more work. A potential side business for my friend might be assisting new restaurant owners where they might locate a new restaurant, who their competition is and who their clientele might be.\n",
